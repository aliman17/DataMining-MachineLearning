BEAVER CREEK - Midway through the ladies' downhill, Slovenia's Tina Maze led the competition at the

Alpine World Ski Championships.

American skier and Colorado native Lindsey Vonn had a rough run and is currently in fifth.

Maze took the lead from Austria's Anna Fenninger beating her by two-hundredths of a second. Switzerland's Lara Gut is currently third on the podium.

Americans Laurenne Ross, Julia Mancuso and Stacey Cook all finished farther in the pack.

Maze took second in the super-G Tuesday. Defending world downhill champion Marion Rolland of France tore the ACL in her right knee during a crash in mid-January and won't compete.

VONN READY TO UPGRADE

Vonn skies a lot of events. If you add together all of her accomplishments, she has more world cup wins than any female racer in history. But the downhill event is Vonn's favorite. It was a beautiful day on the race course on Friday. She already has a bronze medal from her accomplishment in the Ladies super-G on Tuesday.

Her grandparents, parents and so many of her friends have been on the sidelines, cheering her on.

ICY COURSE

Many novice skiers would be shocked to learn race coordinators actually use fire hoses to ice the downhill race course. The point of icing down the race course is to give athletes speed and a consistent surface.

It also holds up more after many skiers race on it.

"What we are really doing is turning what we call snow into a layer of concrete," Men's Chief of Race Greg Johnson said. "It's pretty must like an 18-inch layer of rock, hard ice. It's not so much snow anymore for racing."

There are two runs being raced on during the two-week event: Raptor and Birds of Prey. Once the racing events are over, the ice will be broken up, the runs will be groomed and softened for public use.
