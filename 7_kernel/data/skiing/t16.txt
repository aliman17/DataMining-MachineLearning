AIL - Snow was a game changer at the Alpine World Ski Championships Wednesday. Too much snow and wind caused the men's Super-G to be rescheduled for Thursday at 11 a.m.

The weather has also canceled Thursday's women's downhill training. The men's super-G was scheduled to start at 11 a.m. at the Birds of Prey racecourse on Wednesday before the weather moved the event.

Ted Ligety is the 2013 defending super-G world champion and has dominated the course his past few seasons.

Sochi Olympic Champion Kjetil Jansrud will try to replicate Anna Fenninger's results Tuesday and back up his Olympic gold with the World Championship.
