BEAVER CREEK, Colo. –Bode Miller said if his crash at the world championships was indeed his last race he's all right with that because his career has been "an amazing ride."

In his first interview since surgery on his severed right hamstring tendon, Miller told The Associated Press on Friday he is still deciding whether to return next season. The 37-year-old skier and his wife have a baby due in May, and Miller doesn't want to race if he "can't commit the time and energy to get the preparation done.

"The preparation is pretty demanding, requires summers and requires unbelievable commitment to fitness and the dry-land program," he added. "That's just really hard to juggle with my priorities right now. I love racing. But I just don't know."

The six-time Olympic medalist sustained a deep cut when his ski sliced him in the crash during the super-G. Another cut inside severed the tendon. He tried to get doctors to sew up only the outside – and deal with the tendon later – so he could race Saturday in the downhill.

"If I was tougher than I am, I probably could've had them sew the thing up and leave the hamstring tendon completely cut," Miller said.
