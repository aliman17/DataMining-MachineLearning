BANKSO, Bulgaria (AP) — Lindsey Vonn criticized the International Ski Federation Monday for allowing skiers to race in foggy conditions in Bulgaria.

The 30-year-old American, who missed nearly two seasons of competition after injuring her right knee in Austria in 2013, accused FIS of restarting the super-G leg of Sunday's combined race too soon.

Competing just after a race restart, Vonn finished in a surprise 24th place, with the TV cameras unable to follow her as she skied through a patch of cloud.

"I don't think the conditions were safe enough to be racing — for the fog and also the snow conditions ... I said the fact we were racing in those conditions was a joke," Vonn said at the end of the tournament in Bansko.

"I'm just a bit frustrated with the FIS and their approach to safety ... I'm trying to make sure that athletes are safe and hopefully someone is listening to me at some point."

Fog held up racing for two days in Bansko and plagued the event on Sunday with repeated delays.

Vonn said the situation reminded her of her ill-fated race in Schladming, Austria two years ago, where she had to be airlifted to hospital after a crash.

"The situation happen like in (2013) when I blew my knee out — they had the same situation when they had to delay the race and snow conditions weren't good. But they still pressed on," she said.

"I've been in the World Cup for 15 years and I feel like it's never changing."

The FIS had no immediate response to Vonn's comments, but federation officials say race officials are in continuous contact with coaches before a decision is made to restart races.

Vonn made skiing history on the World Cup circuit in January with a record 63rd win.

On Monday, she finished third in the super-G, behind overall title chasers Anna Fenninger and Tina Maze.
