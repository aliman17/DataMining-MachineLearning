BEAVER CREEK, Colo. (AP) - Anna Fenninger of Austria added a world championship super-G title to her Olympic gold medal, winning the event Tuesday on a shortened course and in blustery conditions.

Fenninger found the perfect line and finished in 1 minute, 10.29 seconds. Tina Maze of Slovenia was second, 0.03 seconds behind, and American Lindsey Vonn wound up third despite a wind gust standing her up early in her run.

Vonn, the favorite in a race so close to her hometown, momentarily had the lead and the capacity crowd celebrated. Her boyfriend, golfer Tiger Woods, yelled "Yes," after seeing Vonn's name topping the leaderboard.
