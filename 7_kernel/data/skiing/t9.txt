BEAVER CREEK – Hometown hero Mikaela Shiffrin will take the course Thursday at the 2015 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships.

Shiffrin is one of the best in the world when it comes to the giant slalom. Shiffrin finished in fifth place during the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games.

Slovenian hero Tina Maze will also return to the slopes in an attempt to win her fourth medal of the championships. Maze already has two gold medals – downhill and combined – and one silver in the super-G. Maze won the gold at the Sochi Olympics and finished second in the 2013 World Championships.
