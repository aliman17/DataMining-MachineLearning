After his surprising decision to take a year off from ski jumping, Canadian Mackenzie Boyd-Clowes has now decided to return to the sport next season.

"I had to take a year off to rest and recharge. During that year. I realized that I miss the competitions, my teammates and the fans. I’m looking forward to getting back to training and then back onto the circuit in the winter", the 23-year-old is quoted on skijumpingcanada.com.

Of course head coach Gregor Linsig is happy about this decision of his best ski jumper. "Mac is a natural athlete – once he gets back in shape, it will be like he never left. I’m looking forward to having him back, he makes Team Canada that much stronger".

Mackenzie Boyd-Clowes, who achieved his best World Cup result at the ski flying event in Bad Mitterndorf in January 2014 with a ninth place, will train in Calgary (CAN) and Europe in summer, before he wants to compete in the World Cup again next winter.
