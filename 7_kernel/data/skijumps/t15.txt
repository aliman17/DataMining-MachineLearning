The Norwegian Ski Association announced the men's and ladies' national teams for the upcoming season on Wednesday.

The men's A-Team for the 2015/16 season will consist of Rune Velta, the normal hill World Champion, world record holder Anders Fannemel, Junior World Champion Johann Andre Forfang, Kenneth Gangnes and Phillip Sjoeen. Line Jahr and Maren Lundby were named to the ladies' World Cup team.

It is planned that both teams shall hold more joint training camps in the future.

"We believe, that this is what it takes to take the girls to the next level. It's a great thing for Maren and Line, that's why only two girls are on the team. In the men's team we have an interesting change of generations. Two experienced jumpers ended their careers, two young athletes are new on the team. Kenneth Gangnes returned after a long break due to injury", sports director Clas Brede Brathen is quoted on skiforbundet.no.
