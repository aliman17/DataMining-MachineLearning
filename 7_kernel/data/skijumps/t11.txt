Nicolas Mayer retires

French Nicolas Mayer has decided to end his career. "There are various reasons for this decision. Considering the current situation of ski jumping in France it would be difficult to make it to a high level. In the past we had 10 athletes and five to six coaches, now there are three athletes and two or three coaches. I need a real team to further develop my performance and in that case this is difficult. I had high goals, but I don't think it would be possible to achieve them. And there are also financial aspects", the 24-year-old explains on nordicmag.info.
