The Polish ski jumpers have started their preparations for the upcoming season and spent last week in Cetniewo at the Polish Baltic Sea.

The main aim of the camp was to get the whole group together again after a short spring break, some medical and physical tests were carried out, on top of that individual goals for the near future were set. Just before the team left for the camp, the jumpers were subjected to medical tests at the Central Sports Medicine Institute in Warsaw. Convinced about the beneficial effects of colder sea climate, as well as the necessity to introduce variation into everyday's training routine, head coach Lukasz Kruczek decided to take the team to the Polish seaside this time. “The guys are all healthy, motivated and in a pretty good shape as well,” added Kruczek.

All throughout the week the weather was exceptionally good, which allowed the jumpers to fully realize their aims and camp program. “This was a pretty short but intense camp, there was no time at all to get bored,” commented Piotr Żyła. The team exercised at the beach, played soccer and beach volley ball; some even took the chance to swim in the icy waters of the Baltic Sea, which at this time of the year has temperatures around 11 degrees Celsius. As part of the preparation for the upcoming season, the team regularly took advantage of the local cryotherapy chamber, where temperatures go down to -120 degrees Celsius.  

On one of the very first days of the camp, the team took a 7,5 km kayak rally down the Piasnica river flowing into the Baltic Sea. On the very last day, Polish jumpers had a chance to try a bit of sky diving and practice their feeling in the air.

The athletes and their coaches are satisfied with how the camp went. The jumpers will now return home for a few days of individual training. The first jumping sessions will be held in Szczyrk early June. Afterwards, all three teams will travel to Planica (SLO) for the first jumping camp.
