The FIS Nordic Ski World Championships in Falun last winter were a success for the Swedish organizers, not only from a sporting point of view, but also financially.

"The results exceeds our expectations by far. On the day of the opening ceremony we had sold over 170,000 tickets and we then realised that there was potential for a very good financial result. The amount of sold tickets ended at 228,000, which lead to the fact that the income from tickets and hospitality improved with approximately 25 million SEK compared to budget”, explains Sven von Holst, CEO of the Organizing Committee Falun 2015. After a project duration of five years, The aggregated income amounts to 307,7 million SEK (approx. 33 million EUR) and the costs amount to 265,7 million SEK (approx. 29 million EUR).

Also lower costs for the accomodation and transportation of the teams and the big interest of the sponsors contributed to the very good financial result of the WSC. “I want to take the opportunity to thank our partners for their important support. In addition, I would like to thank the swedish cross-country team, which attracted the spectators to Falun through their success. Last but not the least, I want to thank all our fantastic volunteers. Without them this would not have been possible", von Holst added.

After the success of this event, the city of Falun now wants to bid for Championships again in the coming years. "Of course we are very happy about the good financial result of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Falun. Our ambition is to host a new World Ski Championships within the next 10-14 years. Hopefully this positive result will lead to that the inhabitants in Falun become even more positive to arranging big events like these", said Jonny Gahnshag, chairman of Falun 2015.
