Martin Kuenzle ends his job as head coach of the Swiss ski jumping team after seven years and will work as a junior's coach from now on.

His successor as coach of the national team is Pipo Schoedler, who was previously working with the Swiss Continental Cup team. German Ronny Hornschuh will be the assistant of the 41-year-old. Roger Kamber is the new coach of the COC team.

"We have been thinking about the upcoming three years until the next Olympic Games intensively for a couple of months now. I'm very happy that these changes allow us to keep the complete know-how in our coaching staff, while the athletes on all levels will get new inputs. With Martin Kuenzle our most experienced coach will go back to coach juniors. This will be extremely valuable for our young ski jumpers", Berni Schoedler, head of ski jumping, is quoted in a release of the Swiss Ski Association.

"After seven successful and very interesting years in the World Cup I'm looking forward to the new challenge where I'll be able to work in Switzerland a lot more, also in winter", Martin Kuenzle said about his new task.

Future of Ammann still open 

It's still not clear yet, whether the new head coach Pipo Schoedler can plan with Simon Ammann as the leader of his team. "Right now I have many discussions and I'm taking my time to make my decision. I'm looking forward to the new energy on all the different levels and, at the same time, I want to thank my coach and friend Martin Kuenzle for his great work over the past seven years. With his huge know-how it's very important that he will still be part of the team", said the four-time Olympic Champion.

At the same time with the new coaching staff, also the teams for the upcoming season were announced:
