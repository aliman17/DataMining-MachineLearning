The young jumpers Alessio Longo, Kevin Rosenwirth and Joy Senoner are on the so-called Team FuturFISI. 

Head coach Paolo Bernardi shall be responsible for the ski jumping and the nordic combined team. The coaches of the men's ski jumping team will be Walter Cogoli and Arrigo Della Mea.

No ladies' team

A ladies' team was not named so far. According to a report on neveitalia.it the bad results this past winter are the main reason for this decision, also head coach Julien Eybert-Guillon will not continue his job with the Italian Ski Association.
