By the deadline on May 1st, 2015, three venues with a long tradition in ski jumping submitted applications to organize the FIS Nordic Ski World Championships 2021.

Oberstdorf (GER), Planica (SLO) and Trondheim (NOR) want to host the Championships six years from now. Planica is also the only candidate for the FIS Ski Flying World Championships 2020.

"Just weeks after the successful FIS World Championships in 2015, FIS is pleased at the interest for the organisation of these important events. Experienced Organizers including the world's premium resortsâ€™ desire to host FIS World Championships underlines their importance in the global sports calendar," commented FIS President Gian Franco Kasper.

A first briefing of the candidates will take place at the FIS Calendar Conference early June in Varna (BUL). Then a detailed concept is due by September 1st, 2015. This concept will be reviewed by the FIS Inspection Group, led by Secretary General Sarah Lewis, before the next meeting with the candidates early October.
