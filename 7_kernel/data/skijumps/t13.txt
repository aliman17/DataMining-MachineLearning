The Finnish ski jumping teams for the 2015/16 season were officially announced on Thursday and various well-known names were missing on the lists.

Anssi Koivuranta, Ville Larinto and Sami Niemi are not on one of the teams of head coach Jani Klinga for next season. While Anssi Koivuranta has already told that he will take a longer break, it's not clear yet, whether the other two will continue their careers or not.

"Now that the training starts again, I don't have the necessary motivation and so it doesn't make sense to compete next season. I will take at least a year off, but I haven't made a final decision yet, if I'll continue or not. The WSC 2017 in Lahti are still on my mind", Anssi Koivuranta, who also mentioned knee and back problems as a reason for this decision, said on the website of the Finnish Ski Association.

Jani Klinga explained the team nomination and the situation of Larinto and Niemi. "Ville and Sami didn't quit, they want to leave their future open. There are certain criteria for the A-Team and that's why is relatively small. But there are strong challengers for this group, with young, ambitious athletes like Niko Kytoesaho. Both teams will work closely together."
