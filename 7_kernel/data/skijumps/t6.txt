On Wednesday the Norwegian Ski Association announced that, besides the national team, there will also be a B-team with eleven male and one female jumper for the upcoming 2015/16 season.

On the team are Tom Hilde, Andreas Stjernen, Daniel-Andre Tande, Robert Johansson, Joachim Oedegard Bjoereng, Joachim Hauer, Vegard Swensen, Sigurd Nymoen Soeberg, Halvor Egner Granerud, Are Sumstad, Fredrik Bjerkeengen and Anniken Mork, they will be coached by Thomas Lobben, Roy Erland Myrdal and Henning Stensrud.

Every athlete has to pay 75 000 Norwegian Kroner (approx. 8900,- Euro) to be a part of this B-Team and get the support of the ski association. "Of course it would be better if this wasn't necessary, but we are not living in a dream world. The alternative would be to not do anything. We offered this possibility to the 12 athletes and everyone accepted it. This means, that the offer was good", sports director Clas Brede Brathen said to Norwegian TV NRK.

"It's far from ideal. We will see if it's worth it. But it's the best offer we have and the only solution", Tom Hilde is quoted on nrk.no.
